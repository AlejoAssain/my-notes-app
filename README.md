### PD: I was working in the UI and testing, but I ran out of time, so here it's my project! I'll be improving the project because I really enjoyed doing it! Just in case, I'll leave here my own repository with the improvements of the project that I'll pushing by the following days https://github.com/AlejoAssain/my-notes-app.git
